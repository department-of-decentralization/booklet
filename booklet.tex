\section {\textsc{Asynchronous Phil} -- Measuring Decentralization Across L2 Networks
} \noindent \textit {Magazin - Main Stage, 09:30 CEST, Governance \&
 Society
}\\[1em] Many studies and analyses have been performed on Layer-1 protocols that measure decentralization to the point where we have an accepted set of standards. Such standards include, but are not limited to, nakamoto coefficient, validator distribution, and full node counts. This talk explores the challenges in measuring decentralization across layer-2s on Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos where the technology varies and creates new avenues of centralization more obscured from the view of users.

\section {\textsc{Thomas Jay Rush, Dawid Szlachta} -- Indexing Ethereum Mainnet for Near-Zero Cost
} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Side Stage, 10:00 CEST, Infrastructure
}\\[1em] A discussion about EVM client software, why it can't deliver accurate transactional histories (hint: it's missing an index), and what it would be like if it could.
\par In this talk, we describe the Unchained Index: a system for creating a naturally-sharded, immutable index for any EVM-based blockchain including L2s.

Using only the node software as its data source, the Unchained Index visits every binary corner of the chain's history, searching for address appearances (which is way more complicated than one might think). The algorithm is well-documented and open source. This ensures that the process is permissionlessly reproducible. The result of this indexing is stored as a collection of chunks.

By building chunks (``a time-ordered log of an index of a time-ordered log''), fronting the chunks with Bloom filters, and maintaining a manifest of all chunks and Blooms, we create an off-chain index that lives naturally on content-address stores such as IPFS. We publish the hashes of all parts of the index to a smart contract.

End users (by querying the Bloom filters via the smart contract) may download only that portion of the index that they are interested in (i.e., their own histories). This ensures that the system works on small machines. Using ``Pin by Default'' the system realizes the massive benefit of enlisting end users in the distribution of the chunks. Heavy users acquire, pin, and distribute a

 Society
}\\[1em] In this talk I want to share about Retroactive Public Goods Funding, what we learned in running 2 rounds of RetroPGF at Optimism, and what's next on our journey to summon Ether's Phoenix.
\par Cyberspace today suffers from a monumental market failure because its economic ruleset was built for the physical world. Public Goods are core to the growth of cyberspace but our current markets are unable to nurture that growth. Web3 presents an opportunity for cyberspace to only be occupied but governed by its citizens and reinvent how we organize and fund public goods in this digital age.

Optimism is experimenting with a new economic mechanism called Retroactive Public Goods Funding, in which citizens reward the creation and maintenance of public goods proportional to how much impact these public goods provide to the collective.

In March '23, we concluded our second RetroPGF experiment, where 69 Badgeholders allocated 10M OP among 195 Projects. We learned a bunch. We're on to the next experiment with exciting new improvements. One step closer to Ethers Phoenix.

}\\[1em] In this hands-on workshop, we'll learn how to use the Radicle stack to collaborate on a code project. We'll run our own nodes, connect to peers, and grow a virtual garden together.
\par Radicle is a local-first, peer-to-peer network for code collaboration, built on top of Git. It enables users to run their own nodes, ensuring censorship-resistant code collaboration and fostering a resilient network without reliance on third-parties.

Radicle functions as a protocol where each user on the network runs identical software, known as the Radicle Stack. This stack primarily consists of a command line interface and a networked service called the Radicle Node.

Users can also opt to run the Radicle Web client and HTTP daemon, providing a familiar web-based experience for enhanced accessibility and convenience.

In this workshop we will explore Radicle's code collaboration workflow by:

} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Workshop 1, 11:00 CEST, Infrastructure
}\\[1em] The dm3 protocol is the web3 messaging protocol focusing on encryption, decentralization, scalability, and in particular interoperability. It utilizes the essential features for a lean messaging base protocol: a registry for public keys and decentralized delivery service nodes.
\par Email, SMS, and messengers such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and others are known and used by almost everyone today. The lack of comprehensive end-to-end encryption for e-mail and closed data silos for central messenger services are currently common. Cross-application communication is not possible. User profiles are under the control of large corporations.

With web3 we have new possibilities like key-based identities, decentralized registries on the blockchain, and end-to-end encryption, \ldots
{} In the last month, several web3-based messaging solutions were introduced. While encryption, security, and privacy are consistently implemented, interoperability is still not yet solved but is needed even more.

With \textbf{dm3}

 Incentivising Core Protocol Work
} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Side Stage, 11:00 CEST, Governance \&
 Society
}\\[1em] The Protocol Guild aims to secure the future of Ethereum, by enabling a highly efficient way for its ecosystem and community to sustainably fund core protocol development, while rebalancing incentives for core protocol contributors.
\par The Protocol Guild itself is a collective of Ethereum's active core protocol contributors, which is today comprised of 130 individuals from +20 different ecosystem teams. These individuals are focused not only on maintaining Ethereum and the EVM as it exists today, but also on researching and implementing cutting-edge advancements which will help onboard the next wave of global users seeking the benefits of decentralized and censorship-resistant protocols. In short, the work done by this collective is of extreme importance to the long-term security of Ethereum.

Nevertheless, funding for core protocol work has historically come from a select number of entities, which only provides a fraction of the financial incentives compared to other available work (apps, L2s etc.), on a risk-adjusted basis. The Guild was created to serve as a counterbalance to this (and at worst, a funder of last resort), while providing core protocol contributors with a way to indirectly participate in the success of the broader ecosystem, and incentivize continued contributions over the long term.

In this presentation, I'll detail the different attributes and assurances that make Protocol Guild

\section {\textsc{Christian Reitwiessner} -- powdr - a modular stack for zkVMs
} \noindent \textit {Magazin - Main Stage, 11:00 CEST, Cryptography
}\\[1em] In the recent months, there has been a surge in the popularity of zkVM implementations. Many of these use specialized solutions and code, sometimes even all the way down to the cryptography, which makes these zkVMs very monolithic and non-interoperable.

Powdr takes a modular approach to designing and constructing zkVMs, employing multiple compilation and optimization stages to arrive at the final prover and verifier. Users can define custom instruction sets for a VM, specify how those compile to constraints, generate sub-machines and declare how to connect them. Moreover, the flexibility of powdr enables users to select from a variety of proving backends when generating the prover and verifier components.

To validate this concept, we have successfully developed a fully functional verifier that compiles (no-std) Rust code into eSTARK and Halo2 proofs via the RISC-V architecture. Additionally, we are currently working on adapting this verifier to wasm and Valida, VMs that take very different architectural approaches than RISC-V.

}\\[1em] Metadata privacy is critical for personal and private data access. Today, mixnet-like systems are still the only privacy option for low latency data transfer that have been proven at scale. Other techniques are not far behind though, and can allow us to get similar or stronger privacy guarantees without sacrificing latency. I've advised a \href{https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2022/announcing-rfp-014-the-one-with-private-retrieval/}{funding program}
 over the last year aimed at supporting the transition to practice of private retrieval. This talk will survey currently available systems, and our current guesses for what methods can scale to widespread adoption.
\par Last year, Protocol Labs launched a funding program for metadata-private data transfer. This program is rooted in the belief that a combination of cryptographic and systems techniques should be able to offer low latency private data transfer at scale.

We have worked with groups investigating paths by which PIR, Private set intersection, Multiparty Computation, trusted hardware, and homomorphic encryption can be applied to this problem. This talk will describe the state of the art, overhead costs, and promise of these various techniques.

We'll also look at ways in which the the problem can be relaxed. Traditionally, data transfer has focused on a web2 model of a single authoritative origin. Using content addressed data means both that integrity

\par Given an ethereum address, get all transactions involving it. Such a simple and fundamental thing to ask, though all EVM chains and other EVM inspired chains clients simply can't answer this easily.

The way the node client is built it's unable to provide this answer which has given raise to a host of problems as new protocols and indexing services arise to fill in the gap. As ethereum protocol development enters its 10th year the problem seems to be ignored and sweeped under the rug, such as with the removal of archive nodes.

All the above leads to a very unfortunate centralization of what was supposed to be a decentralized protocol. In the talk we will try to analyze the problem, some existing solutions and approaches and how we can do better so that ethereum can go into the next 100 years and have historical data available.

}\\[1em] The ``Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer'' (or just Polkadot UC), represents the public service provided by the Polkadot Network: it is a trust-free, WebAssembly-based, multicore, internet-native omnipresent virtual machine which is highly resilient to interference and corruption. The present system of allocating resources of the Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer (parachain slot auctions) is based on a model of one-core-per-parachain: this is a legacy interpretation of the Polkadot platform and is not a reflection of its present capabilities. With Polkadot's capability to adapt to its users'need, a new paradign for allocating coretime is being implemented by ecosystem teams. Coretime on the Polkadot UC is envisioned to be sold by the Polkadot System in two separate formats: Bulk Coretime and Instantaneous Coretime. When a Polkadot Core is utilized, we say it is dedicated to a ``Task'' rather than a ``parachain''. The Task to which a Core is dedicated may change at every Relay-chain block and while one predominant type of Task is to secure a Cumulus-based blockchain (i.e.~a parachain), other types of Tasks are envisioned. Bulk Coretime is sold periodically on a specialised system chain known as the ``Coretime-chain'' and allocated in advance of its usage, whereas Instantaneous Coretime is sold on the Relay-chain immediately prior to usage on a block-by-block basis.

} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Side Stage, 15:30 CEST, Cryptography
}\\[1em] Blockchains, with their primary focus on decentralization, open participation, and resilience, inherently lack efficiency, scalability, and privacy. Similar to parallel computing algorithms, the scalability of a blockchain-based system depends on the extent to which computational tasks can be moved off-chain. Zero knowledge techniques, such as recursive SNARKs, offer an effective means of shifting computation off-chain, requiring only proof verification as part of the consensus process. Mina demonstrates the use of these techniques in its consensus algorithm Ouroboros Samasika and zkApps. Privacy poses a challenge in blockchain systems due to their open public ledgers. However, zero knowledge proofs enable reduced data exposure on the public ledger and allow fine-tuning of the level of disclosure. Etonec's payment system serves as an exemplary application showcasing enhanced privacy in blockchains.

Considerable infrastructure has now seen the light of day towards refining blockspace and delivering more value across the stack, from users to the protocol. But blockspace is not an homogenous resource, being deeply tied with both the consensus protocols which supply it and the infrastructure which refines it. Comparing notes between ecosystems will allow us to uncover best practices and opportunities to learn from one another.

Our workshop will feature researchers and developers from four different ecosystems, represented by:
Robert Habermeier (Polkadot),
Sam Hart (Skip Protocol),
Jannik Luhn (Shutter Network), and
Barnabé Monnot (Robust Incentives Group @ Ethereum Foundation).

Each speaker will present key facts about their blockspace, its design and its philosophy (4x 8mins each). After these opening remarks, we feature a panel moderated by \href{https://twitter.com/cwgoes}{Christopher Goes}
 (Heliax) to dive into the deep questions (\textasciitilde40

\section {\textsc{Dennis Trautwein} -- The Best of Both Worlds: Exploring the Role of Centralization in IPFS
} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Side Stage, 16:30 CEST, Infrastructure
}\\[1em] Web centralization and consolidation have created potential single points of failure, e.g., in areas such as content hosting, name resolution, and certification. The ``Decentralized Web,'' led by open-source software implementations, attempts to build decentralized alternatives. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is part of this effort and provides a fully decentralized object storage and retrieval layer. This comes with challenges, though: Decentralization can increase complexity and overhead, as well as compromise performance, scalability, and system stability. As the lead developers of IPFS, we have therefore begun to explore more hybrid approaches. In this talk, we will discuss the trade-offs, and our implemented and proposed solutions, as well as give an outlook.

\section {\textsc{Masih Derkani} -- Indexing the Planet For Good
} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Side Stage, 17:00 CEST, Networking
}\\[1em] Immutable and verifiable content plays a key role in shaping the future of knowledge sharing for the good of all. At the same time, content represented in such a way amplifies the importance of routing; hashes are hard to remember, content keeps increasing, data moves and so do peers. This begs the question: how would we find ``stuff'' fast, efficiently and reliably without enabling centralised snooping? Find out what the InterPlanetary Network Indexer is addressing this issue for IPFS and FileCoin network.
\par While the benefits of immutable content are undeniable, a key challenge lies in efficient and reliable routing. With content increasing exponentially and data constantly in motion, the need for fast and secure discovery becomes crucial. But how can we achieve this without compromising privacy and falling into centralized surveillance?

In this talk, we will explore IPNI (InterPlanetary Network Indexer) as a solution to address these challenges head-on. We will begin by understanding the role of immutability in shaping the future of the web and why it is crucial for the integrity of content. Recognizing the need to reduce barriers for adoption, we will delve into the strategies employed by IPNI to simplify the process without compromising privacy or enabling centralized snooping akin to analytics platforms of today.

We will discuss \href{http://cid.contact}{cid.contact}

} \noindent \textit {Loft - Workshop 0, 17:15 CEST, Networking
}\\[1em] The public and private are not opposites, they are complementary: privacy is needed to sustain the security and integrity of people as well as infrastructure that serve the public good. This workshop will demo working code for running Libp2p traffic through the Nym mixnet, built with the Nym Rust SDK.
\par The public and private are not opposites, they are complementary: privacy is needed to sustain the security and integrity of people as well as infrastructure that serve the public good. This workshop presents the cypherpunk principle for understanding the public and private, namely ``transparency for the powerful, privacy for the rest of us'' - showing how to operationalise this in the context of decentralised infrastructures. The workshop presents the Nym mixnet as a privacy commons for libp2p, a core module for decentralised networking, used by Ethereum consensus clients and beyond. Recently, Chainsafe built a proof of concept integration of Nym for Lighthouse. This workshop will demo working code for running Libp2p traffic through the Nym mixnet, built with the Nym Rust SDK.

Distributed infrastructures suffer from a common vulnerability: that traffic is exposed, can reveal IP addresses and be used to deanonymise operators. This puts both operator as well as nodes at risk of DDoS attacks as well as censorship. Mixnets function like a forest surrounding and sustaining the public goods of such core

\section {\textsc{Yajin (Andy) Zhou} -- Operation-level Concurrent Transaction Execution for Ethereum
} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Side Stage, 17:30 CEST, Infrastructure
}\\[1em] Despite the success in various scenarios, blockchain systems, especially EVM-compatible ones that serially execute transactions, still face the significant challenge of limited throughput. Concurrent transaction execution is a promising technique to accelerate transaction processing and increase the overall throughput. Existing concurrency control algorithms, however, fail to obtain enough speedups in real-world blockchains due to the high-contention workloads.

In this talk, I will propose a novel operation-level concurrency control algorithm designed for blockchains.
The core idea behind our algorithm is that only operations depending on conflicts should be executed serially, while all other conflict-free operations can be executed concurrently. Therefore, in contrast to the traditional approaches, which block or abort the entire transaction when encountering conflicts, our algorithm introduces a redo phase to resolve conflicts at the operation level by re-executing conflicting operations only. We also develop a set of data dependency tracking mechanisms to achieve precise identification and speedy re-execution for conflicting operations. We implement a prototype named ParallelEVM based on Go Ethereum and evaluate ParallelEVM using real-world Ethereum blocks. The evaluation results show that ParallelEVM achieves an average speedup of 4.28×. If combined with state prefetching techniques, Parallel

} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Workshop 1, 17:30 CEST, Infrastructure
}\\[1em] This workshop will be led by Federico Kunze Küllmer, who was part of the core team that developed the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Federico is also the co-founder of Evmos, an EVM compatible blockchain that supports interoperable dApps via IBC. Federico will dive deep into the technical aspects of the IBC protocol, exploring how it enables cross-chain communication and discussing how Evmos simplifies the development of interoperable dApps. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn from the speaker's firsthand experience in implementing the IBC protocol and gain valuable insights into developing successful interoperable dApps using Solidity.
\par Join us for a comprehensive workshop on writing interoperable decentralized applications using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). This deep dive session will explore the key architectural components that enable interoperability between dApps, including a detailed deep dive of the EVM and IBC. The workshop will conclude with a hands-on demo, giving participants the opportunity to develop their own interoperable dApps using Solidity. This is an ideal opportunity for engineers looking to advance their dApp development skills and gain practical experience in the emerging field of blockchain interoperability.

\section {\textsc{Sebastian Buergel} -- beyond indexers: trustless application data snapshots
} \noindent \textit {Atelier - Side Stage, 18:00 CEST, Infrastructure
}\\[1em] I will present a trustless application data snapshot architecture based on on-chain hashed lists. I will also demonstrate an implementation of that architecture that is used by HOPR mix nodes to sync data much faster and with very few on-chain reads. The proposed mechanism is an orders of magnitude improvement in indexing speed at the cost of one on-chain hash + read + write of a single storage slot. Our open source base contract can be easily integrated into other smart contracts and combined with various frontend libraries.

\section {\textsc{Richard Meissner} -- How to unleash the power of Account Abstraction
} \noindent \textit {Magazin - Main Stage, 18:00 CEST, Infrastructure
}\\[1em] EIP-4337 gave some guidelines and visibility for Account Abstraction, but this is only the start. To fully unfold the power of smart contract based accounts it requires careful considerations and good standards. In this talk we want to give an overview on the current state of modular smart contract accounts and how to fully take advantage of the flexibility that comes with them.
\par Standards allow developers to group behind a common cause and push initiatives forward in a coordinated manner. For Smart Contract based accounts there are very few such standard in use up to this point, notably only ERC-1271 and ERC-4337. There are quite some initiatives around this topic by different teams which are worth taking a look at. In this session we will give an overview of the current state in this area and also outline how the Safe project is designing a protocol for this.

The following topics will be covered in this presentation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Recap of current state of Account Abstraction: ERC-1271 and ERC-4337
\item The importance of standards for Account Abstraction
\item Unleash the power of Account Abstraction: Safe Protocol and ERC-6900

}\\[1em] With over 2M members Worldcoin has the largest anonymity set for its zero knowledge proof of personhood protocol.
\par The talk will be about ZK Magic and technical aspects. ZKP was first used by ZCash to create transactional privacy (something we still don't have in Ethereum). Then we got distracted by the scaling problem and started developing ZKRollups. We now even have ZKEVMs. All of these require massive proving servers, and that has been the focus of ZKP development.

But we still need privacy, and for that we need small fast provers that users can run themselves. And it needs to run in the wallets. i.e.~in the browser and on their phones. This creates a set of challenges very different from the ones you find in ZKRollups. There are a number of developments, tricks, and research areas that can help devs bring privacy to the users and I will be talking about those.

\section {\textsc{Toby Shorin, Laura Lotti, Sam Hart} -- The Nature of the Protocol
} \noindent \textit {Magazin - Main Stage, 19:00 CEST, Governance \&
 Society
}\\[1em] Since 2019, we've been studying the novel dynamics unlocked by crypto protocols, articulating new mentals model for understanding them, such as ``headless brands'' and ``squad wealth.'' Since our work on public goods and with our experience as researchers and builders, our thinking has taken a more deeply political turn as we consider the long-term impact of crypto protocols as institutional bodies.

Institutional legitimacy and accountability of actors are problems which recur time and again as critical themes in protocol development and operations. Attempts to solve these problems are very wide-ranging, drawing from notions of the state (DAO constitutionalism) to corporations (coin-voting shareholder governance). As a result, protocol work has become a byzantine maze of narratives and mismatched mental models which are often a poor fit for the technical affordances of blockchains.

In this keynote talk, we will share insights from 5 years of techno-cultural analysis in the crypto space. We'll then present several frameworks that reveal how accountability and legitimacy arise---or don't---in crypto protocols. Drawing from legal and political theory (featuring pirates), we'll share a political philosophy of crypto institutions that will help protocol stewards and core developers understand power, behavioral regulation, and even violence in the nature of the protocol.
