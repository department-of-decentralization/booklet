At the time, his research interests lay in the area of IoT and smart sensors, so he authored a few papers on how IOTA ( a DLT for IoT at the time) could be used in agriculture IoT to tap into the market of sensor data. Afterwards, he worked in the area of IoT DevOps and Infrastructure Monitoring, as product and later DevRel, in startups that are considered innovators in their areas. After reading The Sovereign Individual in late 2021, he concluded that his passion was blockchains, a piece of technology with deep political and societal externalities. After spending a sabbatical deep in protocol research, he started working in Nomad as one of the three protocol engineers, and then the hack happened. The Nomad hack was a deeply formative experience, as he saw first hand what it means to be in a war room, mitigate the hacker’s attack, and talk with affected users. Due to his DevOps and Protocol background, he was able to see what was missing from the Security space, and a while after he left to start working on Phylax, which after a few months of coding and research, managed to fundraise for. His drive for security is his fundamental belief that security is one of the biggest challenges that our industry faces. The proliferation of hacks is one of the core attributes that is blocking the space from reaching escape velocity in terms of adoptions, as also serves as never-ending ammunition for regulators in their effort for a crackdown. He is building Phylax cause he wants to solve security in crypto, and he wants to solve security so that crypto can win. And if crypto wins, then everyone, institutions and everyday people alike, can deploy capital with confidence, creating a global financial system that is a little bit less opaque and a little bit more accessible.","avatar":"https://cfp.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/CYFQLS_DjQhExA.png","email":"odysseas@phylax.watch"}],"title":"Contract-based soft forks: Coining a term in search of hack prevention","submission_type":{"en":"Presentation: Standard"},"submission_type_id":1,"track":{"en":"Consensus"},"track_id":3,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"In this talk, we talk about a novel mechanism we call the Credible Layer, which is designed as an overlay mechanism that enables a Blockchain network (L2 or L1) to enable contract-based soft forking.

Yet the modern multi-proposer consensus implementation has grown a lot since HotStuff. THisworkshop will explore the implementation details of recent advances – DAG-based approaches like Narwhal and Sui’s Mysticeti – and reveal how implementation details translate to real-world performance gains. We focus on the nitty-gritty: how network communication patterns and data handling affect throughput and latency. New techniques such as Turbine-like block propagation (inspired by Solana’s erasure-coded broadcast) and lazy push gossip broadcasting dramatically cut communication overhead. These optimizations aren’t just theoretical – they enable modern blockchains to process over 100,000 transactions per second with finality in mere milliseconds​ redefining what is possible in decentralized systems.","description":"In this technical session, we dive deep into how modern multi-proposer consensus works under the hood. Attendees will learn about:\r\n\r\n- Evolution of Multi-Proposer Consensus: How we moved from single-leader BFT protocols to parallel proposal systems,\r\n- Traditional vs. Consistent Broadcast Approaches: A comparison between classical consensus and Byzantine Consistent Broadcast models used in projects like Linera and Sui, and more recently delta and pod. We’ll discuss how consistent broadcast ensures all nodes receive the same transactions (often with less coordination), and examine the trade-offs in complexity, finality guarantees, and network assumptions.\r\n- Network-Layer Optimizations: How advanced networking techniques could amplify consensus performance. We break down gossip-based communication using epidemic broadcast trees (Plumtree), and unpack Solana’s Turbine protocol, a tree-structured broadcast that splits blocks into smaller chunks and disperses them with error-coding, These approaches drastically reduce bandwidth usage and propagation delay, ensuring that even with many proposers, data swiftly reaches every validator.\r\n- Implementation Strategies for Throughput and Latency: Practical engineering tactics that increase throughput and lower latency in a multi-proposer setting. This includes pipelining consensus rounds, batch processing of signatures/cryptography, and exploiting parallelism on modern hardware. We will discuss how small tweaks – like efficient handling of signatures, batching votes, or pruning DAG tails – can yield big wins in performance. Real-world examples (from Sui’s codebase and others) will illustrate how these optimizations are applied.\r\n- MEV Protection in Multi-Proposer Models: An exploration of how having many proposers can enhance fairness and reduce MEV (Maximal Extractable Value). We’ll examine how parallel block production limits any single validator’s ability to control transaction ordering, and how secret sharing or threshold encryption based methods can offer privacy. Attendees will learn how consensus design can complement application-layer MEV defenses to create a more level and transparent playing field for transactions.\r\n\r\nWhy Details Matter – Little Things Add Up: A theme throughout the workshop is that implementation details greatly influence real-world results. We’ll emphasize how seemingly minor optimizations (network message patterns, data structures, timeout handling, etc.) compound into major efficiency gains at scale. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a practical understanding of building multi-proposer consensus systems that are not only correct, but fast. The discussion will be “engineer speaking to engineers,” focusing on concrete designs and code-level choices that turn cutting-edge consensus research into high-performance blockchain infrastructure.","duration":40,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":4,"room":{"en":"Cinema 9 (Workshops)"},"start":"2025-06-12T10:30:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-12T11:10:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-16T19:27:13.185804+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"2 years ago, I delivered a 20min talk about consensus that took a slightly more theoretical tack:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP41IsXCUrw","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":1},{"code":"PGWYAG","speakers":[{"code":"EKWPTX","name":"Teresa Carballo","biography":"panamanian corporate lawyer & governance experimenter","avatar":"https://cfp.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/EKWPTX_nBa53Ov.jpg","email":"teresacarballo@pacifica.legal"},{"code":"7YGDN7","name":"Zimt","biography":"Lawyer in the DeFi space, researcher at BlockchainGov","avatar":"https://cfp.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/7YGDN7_cpGpgJK.jpg","email":"ee@poolmaintenancelabs.io"}],"title":"Not your vote, not your lawyer: Delegation and the Legal Challenges","submission_type":{"en":"Workshop: Standard"},"submission_type_id":4,"track":{"en":"Philosophy"},"track_id":6,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"We will explore the dynamic intersection of delegation and DAOs, concepts driving the future of decentralized governance. Delegation enables more efficient decision-making and distribution of power within DAOs but comes with its risks and challenges both from the delegate and delegator sides. \r\n\r\nWe will dive into how delegation structures work in DAOs and the challenges they pose to traditional hierarchical models from a legal perspective, examining possible legal risks in governance delegation and how to mitigate them.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at real-world examples of successful DAOs and how they leverage delegation to foster innovation, transparency, and collaboration in the decentralized ecosystem, analyzing the particular role of delegates in these ecosystems, and legal measures taken by those ecosystems.","description":"In this workshop, we will explore the evolving role of delegations in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and how they are reshaping governance, organizational structures, and decision-making in the digital age. As decentralized technologies gain traction, DAOs present a revolutionary model for organizational management, offering transparency, inclusivity, and direct participation in decision-making. At the heart of many successful DAOs lies the concept of delegation — the process by which token holders or members assign their voting power to trusted representatives or delegates to act on their behalf in governance decisions.\r\n\r\nWe will begin by introducing the core principles of DAOs: how they operate autonomously using smart contracts and blockchain technology, and how they empower individuals to collectively make decisions without centralized control. Delegation is key in this model, enabling DAOs to balance participation and efficiency, allowing members to delegate authority to experts or trusted representatives, and ensuring that decision-making is informed and agile.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will also highlight the benefits of delegation in DAOs, such as improving governance scalability, fostering accountability, and enhancing decision-making speed. By discussing real-world examples of DAOs, and, we’ll demonstrate how delegation works in practice and how it can support complex decentralized ecosystems. These case studies will illustrate how delegation enables specialized knowledge, streamlines decision-making processes, and supports a more dynamic and responsive governance system.\r\n\r\nHowever, the growth of DAOs and the delegation model is not without its challenges. We will explore several critical legal aspects and obstacles facing DAOs today, including:\r\n\r\nLegal Recognition and Regulatory Compliance: DAOs exist in a legal gray area in many jurisdictions. The lack of clear legal frameworks for DAOs poses challenges around their recognition as legal entities, raising questions about liability, contracts, and enforceability. We will discuss how different jurisdictions are approaching the regulation of DAOs and the implications for governance and delegation.\r\n\r\nDelegation and Accountability: While delegation can streamline governance, it also introduces potential risks such as centralization of power if too much decision-making authority is concentrated in the hands of a few delegates. This can create a disconnect between the broader community and the decision-making process. We will explore mechanisms to ensure accountability, such as transparent voting, regular audits, and incentive alignment to maintain trust in the system.\r\n\r\nJurisdictional Issues and Cross-Border Governance: DAOs often operate across multiple countries and legal systems, making it difficult to apply uniform rules and resolve disputes. Delegates in DAOs may be subject to different national laws, which could complicate the enforcement of DAO decisions, particularly in areas like taxation or intellectual property.\r\n\r\nSecurity and Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Delegation within DAOs is often governed by smart contracts, which are not immune to bugs or vulnerabilities. We will discuss the security risks associated with smart contracts and how DAOs can protect themselves through audits, insurance mechanisms, and governance improvements.\r\n\r\nThroughout the workshop, we will propose potential solutions and best practices to address these challenges, from advocating for clearer legal frameworks to suggesting new governance models that incorporate checks and balances. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of the intersection between delegation, DAOs, and legal frameworks, as well as the governance opportunities and challenges facing these organizations. Attendees will gain insight into the future of decentralized governance, how it can be scaled responsibly, and how the legal landscape may evolve to support or hinder the growth of DAOs in the coming years.","duration":40,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":4,"room":{"en":"Cinema 9 (Workshops)"},"start":"2025-06-13T14:35:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-13T15:15:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-02-11T18:30:33.025791+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"DXWNN9","speakers":[],"title":"Lunch break","submission_type":{"en":"Miscellaneous"},"submission_type_id":6,"track":{"en":"Miscellaneous"},"track_id":8,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"Grab a bite downstairs.","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":7,"room":{"en":"Cinema 7"},"start":"2025-06-13T12:30:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-13T13:25:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-05-21T19:40:51.932454+02:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":"","tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"ZQYZMY","speakers":[{"code":"YJH9RB","name":"Bogdan Arsene","biography":"Political philosopher and public administration education and governance tinkerers for the past decade.","avatar":"https://cfp.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/YJH9RB_Dg427Mo.jpg","email":"arsenebp@gmail.com"}],"title":"Fungibility is All You Need","submission_type":{"en":"Presentation: Standard"},"submission_type_id":1,"track":{"en":"Philosophy"},"track_id":6,"state":"rejected","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel approach to communal configuration grounded in the distribution of fungible tokens.

It provides secure, decentralized messaging and is used by projects like Status, Railgun, and The Graph. An emerging idea is a Waku-based service marketplace, where developers can pay independent providers to deliver infrastructure services, such as querying historic messages, directly to their users off-chain. Using a marketplace instead of running their own nodes reduces complexity for dapp developers, avoids single points of failure, and improves decentralization. Additionally, users could interact with the marketplace directly, choosing providers without relying on the dApp developer. Marketplace consumers would maintain a reputation system to filter out providers with poor service. The marketplace concept is still in early stages. This talk presents the idea, outlines key challenges, and invites technical feedback.","description":"Beyond the core P2P protocol, Waku Relay, which forms the backbone of the Waku network, Waku nodes can offer additional services to lightweight nodes. These Waku Services include Waku Store (querying historical messages), Waku Filter (subscribing to specific message subsets), and Waku Lightpush (publishing messages to the network).  \r\n\r\nCurrently, dApp developers using Waku must operate their own nodes to provide these services to their users. This increases maintenance effort and creates centralization risks. A Waku Service Marketplace could offer an alternative: instead of running infrastructure themselves, developers would pay independent providers to serve their users directly. This model reduces operational complexity while keeping the network decentralized.  \r\n\r\nIn a marketplace model, service providers would compete based on reliability and cost. Since Waku Services operate off-chain, there is no direct cryptographic link between performance and payment. To prevent fraud, marketplace consumers would maintain a reputation system to track provider reliability, ensuring that those offering poor service do not receive new orders. Developers could select providers dynamically, optimizing for performance, redundancy, and pricing. Additionally, a sovereign usage model would be possible—users could bypass the dApp developer entirely, paying providers directly and choosing their own service setup.  \r\n\r\nSustainable incentives are critical to making this work. Providers need fair compensation to maintain service availability, ensuring a robust and censorship-resistant network. This approach removes the need for centralized infrastructure while offering greater flexibility to both developers and users.  \r\n\r\nThis talk will present the technical vision, explore implementation challenges, and discuss how such a marketplace could function. Community feedback is essential to refining the concept and evaluating its feasibility.","duration":10,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":7,"room":{"en":"Cinema 7"},"start":"2025-06-12T14:00:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-12T14:10:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-13T10:25:45.322651+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"CSMVVL","speakers":[{"code":"7GXESP","name":"Naoki Yoshida","biography":"Ethereum auditor at Ackee Blockchain Security.\r\n+5 years of debugging programs.\r\nThe primary audit method is Manually Guided Fuzzing.","avatar":"https://cfp.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/7GXESP_GX0VKPf.jpeg","email":"naoki.yoshida@ackee.xyz"}],"title":"Fuzz Shrinking in Manually-Guided Fuzzing: Minimizing Smart Contract Failing Test Cases","submission_type":{"en":"Presentation: Standard"},"submission_type_id":1,"track":{"en":"Cryptography"},"track_id":4,"state":"rejected","abstract":"Manually Guided Fuzzing on Ethereum smart contracts discovers critical bugs.

By becoming \"based on-demand\" for durations shorter than a full Ethereum slot, rebased rollups efficiently utilize Ethereum’s existing proposer set to facilitate faster transaction confirmations and increased throughput.\r\n\r\nThis presentation explores the technical challenges posed by current Layer 2 (L2) rollups, particularly fragmentation and loss of synchronous composability, and analyzes existing solutions including mesh and hub-based approaches, highlighting their limitations concerning credible neutrality and economic security. We present rebased rollups as a practical solution, detailing their architecture, security trade-offs, and mechanisms such as preconfirmations and dynamic attestation tracking.\r\n\r\nWe conclude by outlining how rebased rollups horizontally scale economic security and transaction throughput, providing Ethereum-aligned synchronous composability with latency comparable to centralized sequencers, ultimately balancing decentralization, neutrality, performance, and cost-effectiveness for the broader Ethereum ecosystem.","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":7,"room":{"en":"Cinema 7"},"start":"2025-06-13T11:30:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-13T11:50:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-07T14:49:27.241078+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"SNZKTA","speakers":[{"code":"VQAEGL","name":"Arik Galansky","biography":"Arik is the VP of Technology at Fireblocks, leading the technology research and innovation with focus on cryptography, blockchain, security and AI research.

Berlin is chosen as a key European capital that has undergone significant change, particularly as a result of financialisation since the early 1990’s. Increasing rent prices have created housing precarity with externalities such as reduced connection of residents to their neighbourhoods and less-frequent use of common spaces.\r\n\r\nThis work builds upon existing prototyping efforts in urban areas around the world in which the use of decentralised technologies, such as blockchains and co-budgeting platforms, have the potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and security in community fund management towards the development of new approaches to funding public infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to answer three research questions in areas regarding a) the lessons that can be learnt from past initiatives, b) considerations for appropriate integration of decentralised technologies, and c) discrete design parameters for NWTM based on the Berlin cases.

JAM is a next-generation blockchain architecture that allows smart-contract-like services to extend the base functionality of the chain. Each service inherits the security of the JAM validator set, and there can be a total of 341 service instances running in parallel per block. By using JAM, we gain access to continuations, deterministic gas metering, and synchronous composability. We think that these actors are the next evolution after smart contracts and writing bare blockchains. Actors will provide a similar level of logic encapsulation as smart contracts while gaining access to the same level of performance and blockspace as blockchains. Right now, we are seeing a push in the direction of vertical and horizontal scaling of blockchains. Vertical scaling only works up to a certain point but enables state locality and thus, synchronous interactions across the whole state. On the other hand, horizontal scaling increases the potential scaling horizon by sharding the execution and/or the data. JAM also scales horizontally by having execution and data sharding. However, it still allows synchronous interactions between the shards to make these shards operate as one instance.\r\n\r\nThis talk will give a high-level overview of the architecture of an actor and how the inherited properties of JAM enable developers to write simple and secure code.

Generality often comes with an efficiency tax: when tasked with highly domain-specific operations, zkVMs demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to specialized circuits. The fundamental tension between generality and efficiency in zkVM design can be resolved with a modular zkVM architecture that allows for built-in specialized circuits directly into the zkVM framework. The implementation maintains the zkVM's verifiability guarantees while dramatically reducing proof generation costs for common operations, as frequently used cryptographic primitives. \r\nThis talk is going to describe an approach to enhance zkVM performance in domain-specific tasks, while carefully managing the trade-off between specialized acceleration and general-purpose efficiency. By thoughtfully integrating precompiles, we achieve significant speedups for cryptographic operations without compromising the zkVM's performance on arbitrary computation.","description":"We are first going to introduce zkVM architectures and discuss the theoretical challenges of integrating precompiles \"chips\" with the zkVM CPU and Memory.

This in turn caused a significant backlash by many in the crypto world leading even to an entire ETH Global presentation in Denver to recount it. However what was most clear during the whole debacle was how few people seemed to know what anyone meant by the word.\r\n\r\nUnironically, there is an element of truth that the angry horde nudged up against in the chaos without understanding what it was. While seemingly contradictory at first glance, the cryptocurrency and blockchain space embody several \"communist\" ideals: decentralization of power, collective ownership structures, removal of exploitative intermediaries, etc. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will challenge the libertarian framing of cryptocurrency as merely an enhanced vehicle for private property rights, demonstrating instead how blockchain systems subvert state-enforced property relations, particularly intellectual property regimes. In fact the usual libertarian framing of crypto is quite unproductive for the space. It was the libertarian framing that made many outsiders and even insiders wrongly believe that NFTs were the equivalent of digital rights management software—a misunderstanding that stems from capitalist property assumptions being inappropriately mapped onto decentralized systems.\r\n\r\nDrawing on one of Robert Merton's  \"four sets of institutional imperatives taken to comprise the ethos of modern science,\" Communism (the others are Universalism, Disinterestedness, and Organized Skepticism), I will show how a communism in practice is inherent to the blockchain space. This is because the space is highly dependent on knowledge production and sharing in order to find alignment in a decentralized ecosystem of actors. By Communism Merton is referring to how all scientists should have common ownership of scientific goods to promote collective collaboration.\r\n\r\nWhile the title may come off a bit edgy to some, the point is not to advocate for some kind of outdated soviet communism in the crypto space, but more to push back against some of the worst capitalistic tendencies that have hurt it. It is time we reframe our political economic understanding of what we are doing and building to not continue to make the same mistakes and find alignment.","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":null,"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-15T22:53:46.680330+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"I'm open to a 25 or 10 minute presentation, however it fits within the scheduling.","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"EGUXVT","speakers":[{"code":"ECJSXL","name":"Victor Grishchenko","biography":"A researcher in decentralized systems, data syncing and CRDTs.

They often rely on civil society and non-governmental organizations to provide digital security and safety support. This relationship is almost always established with trust, often giving full access of personal devices to a trusted entity to conduct forensics. While Amnesty International and Citizen Lab have developed tools to enable journalists to conduct their own basic forensics (mobile verification toolkit) and Apple has entertained the gesture of notifying victims, they always advise to escalate the concern to a trusted NGO. With the scale of commodity spyware and the non-exhaustive list of leaked target names for every scandal, a lot of the NGO support becomes concentrated in few competent and trusted forensics experts. With the volatile nature of government support for NGOs in recent months, it’s clear that NGOs can be subject to unexpected, pulled funding and create conditions for unintended data destruction or leakage.\r\n\r\nSolution: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) practice, especially among European CERTs with platforms like MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) and the STIX2.1 (Structured Threat Intelligence Expression) format, can help consolidate trusted organization indicator sharing, while also standardizing and distributing the efforts to combat sophisticated malware at trustless, individual levels. What has also changed the CTI game from a cat-and-mouse, whack-a-mole paradigm in recent years, is the deployment of wide-ranging corporate networks of honeypots, tripwires, and Active Defense measures. Individual privacy enthusiasts, journalists, civil society and non-governmental organizations alike may benefit from the same streamlined, distributed indicator sharing networks managed through Traffic Light Protocol (TLP): the hidden backbone of static, signature-based malware detection, like VirusTotal, via threat intelligence. TLP is a protocol determining shareability of indicators at designated group levels, and can be augmented further with Semaphore, the ZK protocol validating group membership (Semaphore = Traffic Light). STIX format further supports adequate abstraction for high-level threat modeling, where Diamond Model concepts of threat actor “capability” (high-level) and “infrastructure” (low-level) can be shared without focus on “victim” information. These systems are often overly technical and complex, and not accessible to wide audiences, although threat intelligence and group dynamic analysis are relevant competencies for investigative journalists.\r\n\r\nThe solution proposes the deployment of a distributed indicator sharing network with pub/sub mechanisms for individual journalists. The privacy of individual contributors, as well as sharing platforms like MISP, can be enhanced with zero-knowledge proofs of event submissions, i.e. journalist device-level honeypot mechanisms may provide usable, verifiable data without revealing any submitter identity data. Apple’s notification system and lockdown mode, without providing specific details to the target, is a data point in itself, which can already provide a plethora of meta information, such as country location of the target and device OS without revealing explicitly identifying data. Commercial EDR tools, such as iVerify, also consolidate spyware indicators at scale, albeit iPhone users are submitting phone scan material to a closed, centralized system, where spyware indicators exist in the most personal of mobile data such as SMS or Wellness tracking apps. Notifications may be ignored for some time before a journalist can reach one of the NGOs or their supporting news organization. Additional false positives and “fake” data, or benign participant data, such as distributed volunteer proxies with projects like Tor Snowflake, can be generated to avoid revealing singled-out individuals in a given country. There is clearly a growing need for crowd-sourced approach, where commercial forensics solutions, just like commodity spyware, can reverse intended purpose easily, i.e. Oxygen Forensics or Cellebrite.\r\n\r\nPresentation will include ~5 slides.","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"YNH3JW","speakers":[{"code":"G789GS","name":"Samuel Arogbonlo","biography":"Hi, I'm Samuel Arogbonlo.

In this talk, we will explore the efforts behind PeerDAS and FOCIL metrics standardization, showcasing real-world examples of how unified metrics can streamline feature delivery, improve cross-client validation, and empower researchers to run consistent simulations. By highlighting the successes and pitfalls encountered while building these metrics, we will demonstrate why standardized metrics are essential to maintaining Ethereum’s robust and innovative environment.","description":"","duration":10,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2,"room":{"en":"Cinema 6"},"start":"2025-06-12T14:45:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-12T14:55:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-18T20:38:23.434007+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":1},{"code":"8SWK9S","speakers":[{"code":"JTNE3C","name":"Murdoch Jamie Gabbay","biography":"In 2001 Murdoch Gabbay got a PhD from Cambridge University UK, in mathematics applied to computer science.

We present Hybrid L2s: An L2 combining BitVM, validity proofs, and BTC-staked finality to settle bridges on Bitcoin and Ethereum. \r\nWith the emergence of BitVM, we can build drastically better BTC bridges that reduce trust from a (super)-majority quorum to a 1-of-N assumption. However, BitVM relies on stateless light clients that are hard to build for Ethereum. Hence, we apply a trick for constructing the Hybrid L2: The L2 bridge finality on Bitcoin and Ethereum is a fusion of validity proofs of the L2 and BTC-staking with extractable one-time signatures (OTS). Validity proofs prevent malicious parties from committing safety violations. OTS introduces slashing of equivocation directly on Bitcoin. With BitVM, validity proofs, and BTC-staking, we can support native bridges to Bitcoin and Ethereum on a single L2.","description":"In this talk, we will cover the following three building blocks to create the Hybrid L2:\r\n\r\n- BitVM: BitVM allows for verifying external chains on Bitcoin via a SNARK fraud-proof mechanism at a 1 of N trust assumption. Anyone can be part of this set of N, and thus, active participants only need to trust themselves to ensure that BitVM is secure. BitVM allows a BTC bridge to be built with much better trust assumptions than all existing custodial or multisig bridges for Bitcoin.\r\n- Validity proofs: Using SNARKs over L2 state proposals, any third-party, light client, or external chain can cryptographically verify that the L2 state proposals are correctly created. This forms the basis for validity: In BitVM, we ensure that L2 blocks that include withdrawal transactions back to Bitcoin are correct. On Ethereum, we require validity proof of the correctness of L2 state proposals, making the L2 a validity rollup.\r\n- One-Time Signatures on Bitcoin: The L2 adds BTC-staked Finality Providers (FPs) that sign the L2 state proposals (e.g., Babylon allows such constructions). If FPs sign multiple versions of the L2, they are slashed for the BTC staked on Bitcoin. By integrating slashing for equivocation, the L2 adds economic cost to creating forks and, thereby, an economic incentive to prevent forks. The last property is critical for a hybrid L2. If malicious parties can make two (valid) versions of the L2, bridging operations to Bitcoin and Ethereum would be inconsistent and lead to failures such as possible double-spends (e.g., withdrawing bridged BTC to both Ethereum and Bitcoin).\r\n\r\nWe show how these building blocks are combined to upgrade the BOB L2 from an optimistic rollup to a Hybrid L2. As an interesting side note, combining validity proof for correctness and using BTC stake for finality allows L2s to theoretically support native bridges to other chains besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. L2s could also become a hybrid of chains with bridges to Polkadot, IBC chains, and many more.","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":null,"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-02-09T12:05:33.890657+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"37UXLY","speakers":[{"code":"H3FZNT","name":"Edmund Edgar","biography":"Free software developer based in Mashiko, Japan.\r\n\r\nBuilt the first smart contract oracle, Reality Keys, in 2013.

Arithmetisation is useful in cryptography, because many cryptographic protocols work by exploiting properties of finite fields to prove things like “R holds of a polynomial p”.\r\n\r\nWe note a compositional shallow translation from a fragment of first-order logic with equality, into univariate polynomials. This fragment is expressive, and in particular it is easily powerful enough to express computationally significant things like inductive definitions and combinator reduction. Thus, by arithmetising inductive definitions our translation also arithmetises computation, amongst other things.\r\n\r\nTechniques already exist to arithmetise computation by coding it in an abstract machine whose computation has been arithmetised by hand; i.e. by a deep embedding in some preconstructed monolithic cryptographic artefact. What distinguishes our translation is its shallowness and compositionality: it translates logical connectives directly to operations on polynomials, without a deep encoding in an abstract machine.\r\n\r\nThe translation is, as a piece of pure logical manipulation, deceptively simple and straightforward, but we shall see that the outcome is surprisingly powerful and expressive. Future work is to operationalise it to obtain a useful and practically applicable zero-knowledge or succinct proof-scheme, and we conclude by briefly discussing the barriers to doing this.","description":"Further details can be found in a technical report here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/954","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":null,"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-02-19T08:03:23.630045+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"YFGBSW","speakers":[{"code":"WQE7P8","name":"Andrej Berlin","biography":"Andrej Berlin is an expert in web3-native design and organizational development.\r\nHe is the founder of the decentralised design collective Deep Work.","avatar":"https://cfp.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/WQE7P8_EAb00py.png","email":"andrej@deepwork.studio"},{"code":"N7VMZ8","name":"Beth McCarthy","biography":"Beth McCarthy is a Berlin-based strategist, researcher and experience designer.

His work has shaped the understanding of how biological and artificial systems self-organize and minimize uncertainty.\r\n\t•\tActive inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding intelligence, where agents (biological or artificial) continuously update their internal models of the world to predict and minimize uncertainty. This principle can be applied to decentralized coordination systems, where agents in a network—whether human or AI—adjust their behaviors based on feedback, optimizing trust and governance mechanisms dynamically.\r\n\t•\tImplications for Coordination Systems: Just as living organisms reduce entropy by forming accurate internal models of their environment, decentralized coordination protocols can be designed to function similarly, using trust and reputation as feedback signals that propagate through an adaptive network. The more an agent interacts, the more refined its model of trust and governance becomes, leading to emergent intelligence at scale.\r\n\r\nFlores & Winograd’s Coordination Theory & “Understanding Computers and Cognition”:\r\n\t•\tFernando Flores and Terry Winograd’s book, Understanding Computers and Cognition (1986), argues that coordination is fundamentally a linguistic and social process, not merely a technical one. This perspective shifts the focus from mechanistic transactions to meaningful, structured interactions.\r\n\t•\tTheir coordination theory is based on the idea that all digital and social systems revolve around a structured exchange of commitments—requests, promises, declarations, and retractions. This approach suggests that digital governance should be designed around structured human interactions rather than rigid rule-based automation.\r\n\t•\tApplication to Decentralized Systems: Instead of treating AI or decentralized networks as purely technical infrastructures, they should be viewed as conversational ecosystems, where governance is formed through negotiation, agreement, and evolving commitments. Applying this to AGTP, digital agents could engage in structured conversations that self-regulate trust and coordination and outperform centralized AI systems.\r\n\r\nCoordinating Open Learning: from Philosophy, to Practice:\r\nThe scaling hypothesis—the idea that bigger and bigger models will inevitably lead to AGI—has fallen short of expectations. Leading AI researchers, including Ilya Sutskever, Yann LeCun, François Chollet, Sam Altman, Karl Friston, and Dario Amodei, have acknowledged that simply increasing model size is no longer a reliable path forward. Delays in the release of GPT-5, Claude 3.5 Opus, and other frontier models signal that the era of pure scaling is coming to an end. The transition from closed AI systems to Open Learning is fundamentally a coordination challenge. \r\n\t•\tIlya Sutskever and François Chollet have emphasized the importance of hybrid human-AI learning, where AI is trained not just on static datasets but on live, structured interactions.\r\n\t•\tKarl Friston’s active inference framework supports the idea that intelligence emerges from real-time adaptation, rather than fixed training runs on pre-existing datasets.\r\n\t•\tYann LeCun has proposed architectures like JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures), which rely on self-supervised, dynamically updated models instead of traditional transformers.\r\n\t•\tDario Amodei and Anthropic have explored “Constitutional AI,” an approach where AI is shaped by iterative, community-driven reinforcement learning rather than brute-force scaling.\r\n\t•\tAI systems improve when diverse, trusted data sources are integrated, ensuring quality, novelty, and adaptability rather than rigid optimization for static datasets.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental bottleneck is not model size or computational power but the availability of high-quality, trusted learning signals—the feedback data AI systems depend on to refine their reasoning, accuracy, and usefulness. Currently, this data is siloed within corporate infrastructures, limiting innovation and creating inefficiencies. A shift is needed from centralized AI models to distributed, decentralized AI systems that optimize learning across open ecosystems. Instead of monopolized feedback loops controlled by a few entities, intelligence should emerge through networked collaboration, where AI agents and human participants co-create and refine models in a shared, trust-based environment.\r\n\r\nOpen Learning moves AI beyond closed, proprietary training loops into a shared ecosystem where feedback signals are exchanged across platforms and contexts. Three key pillars define Open Learning:\r\n\t1.\tStandardization – Creating open protocols for sharing learning signals across models and organizations.\r\n\t2.\tTrust – Establishing decentralized reputation systems that reward high-quality contributions.\r\n\t3.\tIncentives – Designing ecosystems where individuals and AI agents benefit from improving intelligence collaboratively, rather than hoarding knowledge in closed silos.\r\n\r\nOpen Learning is deeply rooted in cybernetics, emphasizing self-regulating, feedback-driven intelligence, and valence, ensuring AI systems align with meaningful, adaptive human and machine experiences.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the scaling hypothesis represents an inflection point: intelligence can no longer be engineered solely through brute force computation. Instead, it must emerge through networked coordination—across people, AI agents, and institutions—creating a living, open, and participatory intelligence ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAbstract of an upcoming research paper on open learning and AGTP I am co-writing https://drive.google.com/file/d/159KOwAJbLftGGDHbm3ipIIOzyPKeihlq/view?usp=sharing \r\n____\r\nThese philosophical, practical, and design principles form the foundation of my proposal to advance research and discussion on the vision of decentralized coordinated intelligence—where intelligence emerges through open, trust-based interactions rather than sheer computational scale.\r\n\r\nThis could be a 10 or 25 min presentation, or in a panel format.","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"8BFTQP","speakers":[],"title":"Lunch break","submission_type":{"en":"Miscellaneous"},"submission_type_id":6,"track":{"en":"Miscellaneous"},"track_id":8,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"Grab a bite downstairs.","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":1,"room":{"en":"Cinema 10"},"start":"2025-06-13T13:00:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-13T13:55:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-05-21T19:41:01.468711+02:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":"","tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"SEGKK3","speakers":[{"code":"N8HWF7","name":"Lukas","biography":"Part of the ZeroSync team.

The EIP is slightly under-specified and never got traction among core devs (for concerns around post-quantum security among other things) however its key idea is quite simple and brilliant; Funds that are sent to a random address are effectively burned, and if a user can prove knowledge of pre-image of the address they can safely mint it. Now since we can do the poof in ZK, enshrining this in protocol will enable users to move their funds to new accounts without linking it directly to the origin of funds. \r\n\r\nThe key benefit of EIP-7503 comparing to [Tornado Cash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash) and other out of protocol privacy solutions is the ***plausible deniability***, since depositing into the privacy pool looks like sending funds to a random address it is undistinguishable from all other transfers to fresh accounts without outgoing transfers. \r\n\r\n## Simplified, Generalized, and Compliant\r\n\r\nOn Ethereum, the withdrawal from the privacy pool requires minting new coins, so this has to be implemented with a new transaction type. However, for a rollup the logic can be implemented in the canonical bridge, and could be generalized to bridged ERC20 tokens too (not native tokens). The proposal is for Scroll to add `wormhole_transfer_ETH(amount, dest_address, proof_of_burn, nullifier, blocked_addr_list_root)` and `wormhole_transfer_ERC20(token, amount, dest_address, nullifier, proof_of_burn, blocked_addr_list_root)` functions to the L2 canonical bridge that “mint” new ETH/tokens with proper proof of burn. \r\n\r\nMoreover, under EIP-7503 every users of the protocol gets the same privacy pool, with no ability to disassociate from a specific subset of potentially bad actors. Following the lead of http://privacypools.com/, we adopt a proof of burn that takes a list of blocked deposits as public input. Sophisticated entities will provide updated blocked address lists that users can utilize to disassociate from bad actors.\r\n\r\n- no need for new transaction type\r\n- works not only for ETH but also any bridged ERC20 token supported by canonical bridge\r\n- compatible with proof of innocence or disassociation proofs\r\n- allows partial withdrawals\r\n\r\n## The Protocol\r\n\r\n### Deposit\r\n\r\ndraw a random `secret` and send funds to address `sha256(MAGIC_ADDRESS | secret)[12:]`.\r\n\r\n> 💡 Best practice is to use a deterministic pseudo-random algorithm to derive `secret` from the private key `pk`, so they don’t have to custody `secret` moving forward; e.g. `secret = sha256(MAGIC_SECRET | pk | nonce)` for increasing `nonce`.\r\n\r\n### Circuit Constraints\r\n\r\n> 💡 The constraints are described for ETH only but can be easily adopted for ERC20 tokens.\r\n\r\n> 💡 The purpose of the first constraint is to avoid the risk of withdrawal  transactions being snipped in mempool. \r\n\r\npublic input: `nullifier`, `withdrawal_nullifier`, `block_hash`, `amount`, `dest_address`\r\n\r\nprivate input: `dest_address_hash`, `last_nullifier`, `secret`, `nonce`, `balance`, `last_total_withdrawal`,  `next_total_withdrawal`, `balance_merkle_proof`, `nullifier_next_merkle_proof`, `nullifier_last_merkle_proof`\r\n\r\nconstraints\r\n\r\n1. `dest_address_hash = sha256(dest_address)` \r\n2. `nullifier = sha256(MAGIC_NULLIFIER | secret | nonce)` \r\n3. `withdrawal_nullifier = sha256(secret | next_total_withdrawal)` \r\n4. use `balance_merkle_proof` against `block_hash` to check that balance of `sha256(MAGIC_ADDRESS + secret)[12:]` is `balance`.\r\n5. if `nonce=0` then `last_total_withdrawal = 0`\r\n6. else if `nonce > 0` \r\n    1. `last_nullifier = sha256(MAGIC_NULLIFIER | secret | nonce-1)` \r\n    2. use `nullifier_last_merkle_proof` against `block_hash` to check that storage slot `(WORMHOLE_NULLIFIER_ADDRESS, last_nullifier)` is `sha256(secret | last_total_withdrawal)` \r\n7. `amount <= balance - last_total_withdrawal` and \r\n`last_total_withdrawal + amount = next_total_withdrawal`.\r\n8. `sha256(MAGIC_ADDRESS + secret)[12:] \\notin blocked_addr_list_root`\r\n\r\n## Withdraw\r\n\r\n1. require `SLOAD(WORMHOLE_NULLIFIER_ADDRESS, nullifier) = 0` (no double spend/withdraw)\r\n2. require that `block_hash` be root of a valid past block. \r\n3. `SSTORE(WORMHOLE_NULLIFIER_ADDRESS, nullifier) = withdrawal_nullifier`\r\n4. send `amount` to `dest_address`\r\n\r\n> 💡 note that `last_total_withdrawal` is a private input to the circuit, so the user has to remember how much has been withdrawn so far to make a new withdrawal complicating the UX. A simple fix is to store `next_total_withdrawal` encrypted under user’s `pk` on chain in a map! e.g. `SSTORE(WORMHOLE_WITHDRAWAL_MEM_ADDRESS, nullifier) = enc_pk(withdrawal_nullifier)`. \r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n## Further Improvement Ideas\r\n\r\n- (major) gas sponsorship for the withdraw transaction to further ensure un-likability of source and destination.\r\n- (minor) deterministic pseudo-random secret generation (we don’t want to force the user to custody anything beyond private-key). Users also need to remember the total withdrawal amount which requires wallet support or store encrypted on-chain (hurting forward secrecy, though it may not be a big concern).\r\n- (minor) consider having a fixed denominated list of deposit amounts for simpler UX, if user is not interested in partial withdrawals.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\n- balance tracking becomes non-trivial, you need to be aware of the wormhole.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n*original proposal  https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7503*\r\n\r\n*RFC for ERC20 tokens  https://ethresear.ch/t/rfc-eip7503-private-transfers/18664*\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jimjimvalkema/scrollZkWormholes","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":null,"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-10T15:30:11.746280+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"UYVRBK","speakers":[{"code":"ULYHJB","name":"Hira Siddiqui","biography":"Hira is the co-founder & CEO of Plurality Network, an open context layer to enhance web3 onboarding and enable contextualized and personalized user experiences. \r\nHira has been working in the blockchain space since 2016 and was part of over 50 token offerings in 2017.

While we have achieved technical decentralization, we have yet to establish truly decentralized governance, economic structures, and access to infrastructure and applications.\r\nResilience means decentralization at the foundational layer across multiple dimensions: Technical, Economic, Access, Knowledge, and Governance [4].\r\n\r\nKey features to build a resilient basis include:\r\n\r\n - Proof of Personhood as a Foundation for 1 Person, 1 Vote Governance\r\n\r\n - Citizen’s Dividend for Economic Decentralization\r\n\r\n- Checks and Balances Integrating Meritocracy and Token-Weighted Governance\r\n\r\n- Token Distribution Strategies for Long-Term Economic Fairness\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss these features one by one and propose a combination as a feasible approach for designing a (more) democratic Layer 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n ---\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Fracassi, Cesare, Khoja, Moazzam, and Schär, Fabian (2024).

This work analyses the manipulability of Ethereum's DRB implementation, RANDAO, in its current consensus mechanism. Even with its efficiency, RANDAO remains vulnerable to manipulation through the deliberate omission of blocks from the canonical chain. Previous research has shown that economically rational players can withhold blocks - known as a block withholding attack or selfish mixing - when the manipulated RANDAO outcome yields greater financial rewards.\r\n\r\nWe introduce and evaluate a new manipulation strategy, the RANDAO forking attack. Unlike block withholding, whereby validators opt to hide a block, this strategy relies on selectively forking out an honest proposer's block to maximize transaction fee revenues and block rewards. \r\nIn this paper, we draw attention to the fact that the forking attack is significantly more harmful than selfish mixing for two reasons. Firstly, it exacerbates the unfairness among validators. More importantly, it significantly undermines the reliability of the blockchain for the average user by frequently causing already published blocks to be forked out. By doing so, the attacker can fork the chain without losing slots, and we demonstrate that these are later fully compensated for.","description":"In Proof-of-stake Ethereum leaders (aka block proposers) are selected by a distributed randomness beacon (DRB) protocol called the RANDAO. If Ethereum's leader selection algorithm was fair, then a validator with X% of the stake would obtain, on average, X% of the proposed blocks. However, economically rational validators can manipulate the RANDAO, in order to increase their share of the proposed blocks, thus, increasing their profit, i.e., transaction fees, block rewards, and MEV.

Switching from full transaction data to State Diffs (SDs)—succinct representations of state changes—offers significant cost reductions but introduces security challenges related to data withholding and equivocation attacks.\r\n\r\nThis presentation analyzes critical security trade-offs associated with adopting state diffs, highlighting the vulnerabilities introduced by straightforward state diff implementations (such as withholding transaction data or exploiting proving system bugs). \r\n\r\nWe examine novel proposals to mitigate these risks. Most notably, a challenge timeout that anyone can submit after which, if the full TD corresponding to a SD has not been submitted, the SD gets reverted. While this challenge timeout has implications on the finality of withdrawals to L1 (on-chain finality), we show work arounds that preserve the same security of full TD posting with the timeout while still preserving low on-chain finality. Other novel workarounds include public transaction hash commitments (subcommitments), incentivized DA challenges, slashable sequencer stakes, attestation mechanisms (leveraging BLS signature aggregates), and hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs).\r\n\r\nThe discussion evaluates each mitigation's practicality through several metrics:\r\n\r\nEngineering complexity and implementation effort\r\n\r\nOngoing maintenance and operational costs\r\n\r\nIncremental security improvements and applicability to general state vs. fungible assets\r\n\r\nLatency implications for end users\r\n\r\nRisks and impacts on rollup service continuity\r\n\r\nWe present a roadmap prioritizing the easiest and most impactful security measures to implement first, with particular emphasis on protocol-native attestations, consistent broadcast schemes, and subcommitments.

The current Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) supply chain has led to severe centralization, with two builders controlling over 80% of blocks and half of all relays censoring transactions. A promising approach to address this is the \"Holy Trinity of Censorship Resistance\", a combination of enshrined PBS (ePBS), FOCIL (Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists), and encrypted mempools. This approach can even be extended by using Smart Accounts which give users more control over the transaction inclusion process. While this proposal has the potential to restore Ethereum’s fairness and neutrality, challenges remain, particularly around the encrypted mempool design. Those challenges include designing a generalized encryption interface that supports multiple encryption mechanisms, ensuring that encrypted transactions remain decryptable despite changing encryption parameters, and guaranteeing a timely decryption of transactions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will discuss how these 3 pillars can work together and how they can be extended by Smart Accounts. Additionally, we will show a (Gnosis Chain) mainnet demo of the encrypted mempool in action from an end user perspective.","description":"Censorship resistance and decentralization have been foundational principles of public blockchains since the publication of Bitcoin’s whitepaper. However, in today’s Ethereum landscape, these values are increasingly challenged by real-time censorship, which particularly impacts DeFi users relying on time-sensitive trades.\r\nThe current Ethereum transaction pipeline, dominated by Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), faces severe centralization issues. Today, two builders control over 80% of all blocks, and 50% of relays actively censor transactions. To combat this, the community considers a promising solution—coined the \"Holy Trinity of Censorship Resistance\"—which consists of a combination of enshrined PBS (ePBS), FOCIL (Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists), and encrypted mempools.\r\n* ePBS removes the reliance on centralized relays in the transaction supply chain by integrating PBS directly into Ethereum’s consensus layer, reducing censorship risks from intermediaries.\r\n* FOCIL introduces an inclusion list mechanism, ensuring that a committee of validators enforces transaction inclusion in every block.\r\n* Encrypted mempools protect users from frontrunning and censorship by keeping transactions private until inclusion is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nWhile these protocol-level changes are crucial, they can be complemented by user-level tools to ensure maximum censorship resistance. Smart accounts offer a powerful mechanism to prevent frontrunning and enhance censorship resistance by leveraging encrypted ERC-4337 smart account transactions (UserOps). These UserOps can include a verification step to ensure they are executed in the correct order and at the correct index within a block — typically at the top — before carrying out their main action. If this check fails, the transaction won’t execute, making frontrunning impossible. Smart accounts also offer protection in cases where the encrypted transaction gets revealed prematurely, which would otherwise make it frontrunnable.\r\n\r\nEven though this is a rather long-term vision, we believe that the combination of these three technologies has the potential to re-establish Ethereum’s core values of fairness and neutrality. However, there are still some challenges that remain to be solved, particularly about the encrypted mempool design:\r\n* **Openness of Encryption Technology:** Can we build a generalized encryption interface that allows the use of any encryption/decryption mechanism? This would allow us to abstract the exact encryption type and leave that choice up to the provider of the encrypted mempool.\r\n* **Ensuring Decryption for Pending Transactions:** When encryption parameters change, e.g., due to committee rotation, periodic key updates, or a transition to a new cryptographic scheme, pending transactions encrypted under the old system must still be decryptable. How can we ensure that?\r\n* **Best Encryption Type:** Which type of encryption mechanism offers the best liveness and security guarantees under the most reasonable assumptions? \r\n* **In-Protocol vs Out-of-Protocol:** In how far should the three techniques (ePBS, FOCIL, encrypted mempools) be enshrined into the Ethereum protocol and in how far should they operate on the application layer?\r\n* **Inclusion Enforcement:** What is the best measure to enforce inclusion of transactions from the IL?","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":7,"room":{"en":"Cinema 7"},"start":"2025-06-12T11:30:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-12T11:50:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-14T18:48:45.735975+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"BRQJ9E","speakers":[{"code":"ALLJJD","name":"Alistair Stewart","biography":"Alistair is lead researcher at Web3 Foundation mainly working on protocol design.

Why wouldn't we use the available tools that were better? However, as we approached launch, we recognized a flaw, as we discussed the desire to decentralize everything related to our project. There was the potential to decentralize not just the application but also the organizational structure and governance mechanisms, and of course the applications we still have to rely like Github, until we have the alternative solution. This realization led to seven months of intense dogfooding, where we iterated on decentralized review systems, publishing, budgeting, governance thresholds, and community engagement, including a forum component for content discussions linked to each tutorial. This was a good problem to solve as we had not found a forum platform that met our needs and were using a subpar web2 solution. \r\n\r\nThis talk will explore our transition to 'as fully as possible' Web3-native stack, and the barriers we faced (and still face), cost optimization and data storage, data migration and upgradability,  GitHub reliability, governance complexities, and the technical challenges of rendering and displaying content without relying on HTML.

Furthermore, it will discuss definitions of sovereignty and identity, their durability in the Information Age and the ways in which they are (and aren't) put to the test by blockchain technology and the network state movement.","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":null,"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-16T21:05:58.175393+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"I've submitted another proposal for the join session that Lex Gillon is planning with the JUST Open Source Foundation grantees.

Starting from foundational principles, we differentiate transaction data and state diffs approaches, highlighting their respective advantages and complexities in achieving deterministic, revert-free off-chain finality at different levels.\r\n\r\nWe discuss practical methodologies to implement fast off-chain finality and addressing the challenge of reverts through deterministic mechanisms. Furthermore, we analyze the critical trade-off between frequency of data submissions and compression efficiency, examining how frequent batch submissions can reduce finality times but increase operational and DA costs.\r\n\r\nFinally, we introduce subcommitments, demonstrating their utility in simultaneously improving security and data compression.

These specify actions in response to specific observations.\r\n\r\nIf we want to provide certain affordances with specific guarantees to users, we have to find robust embeddings of these commitments into their context: \r\n\r\n- On one side we have the computational substrate, consisting of cryptographic primitives and networks with non-zero latency and no shared clocks. We can only observe events derived from this foundation, which we will futher call the \"physics\" of a protocol.\r\n\r\n- On the other side we have social systems at various scales, ranging from individuals to large organizations. We inherit incentives from these and behavioral assumptions about the actions users of the protocol take need to be compatible with them.\r\n\r\nThe overarching protocol design question then is: How to choose behavioral commitments such that they realize the desired functionalities and guarantees under the constraints of being compatible with inherited incentives and resting on the protocol physics?\r\n\r\nTo answer this, we need to reason about how incentives propagate through the whole protocol and its context. This is hard, since many interesting protocols are systems with many non-trivially interacting components. \r\n\r\n[Compositional game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_game_theory) provides a formulation of behavioral commitments (or the protocol components implementing them) in terms of open games. It enables iterated decomposition of large systems, as well as reasoning about emergent properties of composed systems. Since incentives usually do not compose trivially, we don't get everything for free, but modelling the flow of utility in a unified fashion reduces the cost of reusing components and enables analysis of what happens at their boundaries.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce this framework briefly and show examples where compositional approaches have helped us in the design process of anoma.","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":null,"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-12T16:59:18.485785+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"I don't know if philosophy is the best fitting category, if you feel something else would be a better match, please feel free to change that.","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"FKXWHY","speakers":[{"code":"79CGKW","name":"Lisa Akselrod","biography":"Tech. writer and DevRel at Aztec","avatar":"https://cfp.protocol.berlin/media/avatars/79CGKW_kmypXFB.jpeg","email":"lisaakselrod@gmail.com"}],"title":"Anatomy of on-chain privacy","submission_type":{"en":"Presentation: Standard"},"submission_type_id":1,"track":{"en":"Cryptography"},"track_id":4,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"How private blockchain differs from transparent blockchain: core components:\r\n- Blended private and public state\r\n- Client-side proof generation\r\n- zero-knowledge property (not just a snark)\r\n- Anatomy of a private smart contract\r\n- Private composability\r\n\r\nWhat does it all mean for developers?

Finally, I will address the problems with fully onchain verification and some potential solutions that will enable the proliferation of fully verifiable bridges.","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":null,"image":null,"resources":[],"answers":[],"created":"2025-02-10T16:15:02.143195+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":0},{"code":"RRXKL7","speakers":[{"code":"RRTWX9","name":"Lukas Rajnoha","biography":"Ethereum security researcher at Ackee Blockchain Security.

Unlike traditional fuzzing techniques that rely on randomness or predefined properties, this innovative approach empowers developers and auditors to direct the fuzzing process toward potential vulnerabilities with surgical precision, drastically improving both testing efficiency and vulnerability detection in complex DeFi systems.","description":"Traditional fuzzing techniques like black box and property-based fuzzing often fall short when testing complex smart contracts, leaving critical vulnerabilities undiscovered. In this interactive workshop, participants will learn how to implement Manually Guided Fuzzing — a powerful technique that combines white box knowledge with structured testing flows for more efficient vulnerability detection. Using the Wake Framework, attendees will gain hands-on experience creating targeted fuzzing campaigns that focus on potential attack vectors rather than relying on brute force approaches. By the end of this workshop, participants will have practical skills to implement guided fuzzing in their own security workflows, dramatically improving testing efficiency and vulnerability discovery rates for complex DeFi protocols and integrated smart contracts. Through real-world examples of vulnerabilities caught by this technique but missed by conventional methods, participants will understand why Manually Guided Fuzzing represents a critical evolution in smart contract security testing, placing the power back in the hands of security researchers while providing them with more precise and effective testing tools.","duration":40,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":4,"room":{"en":"Cinema 9 (Workshops)"},"start":"2025-06-13T15:15:00+02:00","end":"2025-06-13T15:55:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[{"resource":"https://ackee.xyz/blog/introducing-manually-guided-fuzzing-a-new-approach-in-smart-contract-testing/","description":"Manually Guided Fuzzing Blog Post"}],"answers":[],"created":"2025-03-19T10:41:28.630445+01:00","pending_state":null,"notes":"","internal_notes":null,"tags":[],"tag_ids":[],"favourite_count":2}]}
