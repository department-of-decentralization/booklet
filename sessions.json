    "Abstract": "This talk will give an introduction to the Anoma protocol architecture and its design process, to share what we learned and elicit feedback on how we could improve both.\r\n\r\nAnoma is a distributed operating system for intent-centric counterparty discovery and privacy-preserving computation on linear and non-linear resources with heterogenous trust assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe protocol architecture has the following (non-exhaustive) goals and design process behind it:\r\n\r\nGoal: Identify good component boundaries, to unbundle features and improve modularity.\r\n\r\nProcess: \r\n- Analyze the outcomes of protocols that came before us, learn from their successes and problems.\r\n- Example components: Consensus Algorithms, Network Transport, Programming Environment, State Machines\r\n\r\nGoal: Maximize composability of components.\r\n\r\nProcess: \r\n- Try to bridge the gap between real world systems and models from Programming Language Theory, Automata Theory and Category Theory.\r\n- Come up with implementation agnostic interfaces using above theory.\r\n\r\nGoal: Maximize flexibility of the protocol stack, since changes in a deployed system are costly, proportional to the significance of the change.\r\n\r\nProcess: \r\n- Decouple dimensions of choice as much as possible, to enable choices to be made independently of each other. \r\n- Minimize the amount of design decisions and make them at the least-significant place. \r\n- Wherever possible, try to push decisions from \"design-time\" to \"runtime\", so users can make them as circumstances change. \r\n\r\nWe will give a high level overview of the architecture and explain, using examples from it, how they are motivated by the process and how they move us closer to the above goals.",

    "Abstract": "A discussion about EVM client software, why it can't deliver accurate transactional histories (hint: it's missing an index), and what it would be like if it could.",
    "Description": "In this talk, we describe the Unchained Index: a system for creating a naturally-sharded, immutable index for any EVM-based blockchain including L2s.\r\n\r\nUsing only the node software as its data source, the Unchained Index visits every binary corner of the chain's history, searching for address appearances (which is way more complicated than one might think). The algorithm is well-documented and open source. This ensures that the process is permissionlessly reproducible. The result of this indexing is stored as a collection of chunks.\r\n\r\nBy building chunks (\"a time-ordered log of an index of a time-ordered log\"), fronting the chunks with Bloom filters, and maintaining a manifest of all chunks and Blooms, we create an off-chain index that lives naturally on content-address stores such as IPFS. We publish the hashes of all parts of the index to a smart contract.\r\n\r\nEnd users (by querying the Bloom filters via the smart contract) may download only that portion of the index that they are interested in (i.e., their own histories). This ensures that the system works on small machines. Using \"Pin by Default\" the system realizes the massive benefit of enlisting end users in the distribution of the chunks. Heavy users acquire, pin, and distribute a larger portion of the index than light users making the system \"naturally fair.\"\r\n\r\nAnd--because we've purposefully enlisted end-users in carrying the burden of the data, the cost of operation is near zero. Everyone shares the burden and reaps the benefits.\r\n\r\nWe're trying to build a true public good, and we wish the system to be sustainable. The only way for that to happen, we believe, is for the cost of the system to be very low.\r\n\r\nTrueBlocks is a two-time recipient of Ethereum Foundation grants, the recipient of a Moloch DAO grant, an IPFS grant, and more than 3,000 individual donations on the GitCoin grant platform. Our work is fully open-source and local first.\r\n<tags>Ethereum</tags>",

    "Description": "Email, SMS, and messengers such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and others are known and used by almost everyone today. The lack of comprehensive end-to-end encryption for e-mail and closed data silos for central messenger services are currently common. Cross-application communication is not possible. User profiles are under the control of large corporations.\r\n\r\nWith web3 we have new possibilities like key-based identities, decentralized registries on the blockchain, and end-to-end encryption, ... In the last month, several web3-based messaging solutions were introduced. While encryption, security, and privacy are consistently implemented, interoperability is still not yet solved but is needed even more. \r\n\r\nWith **dm3**, there exists a lean web3-based protocol for peer-2-peer messaging, which makes it possible to easily integrate secure communication into DApps. Interoperability with other protocols or services can be accomplished with little effort and without compromising on security. Protocol extensions for advanced privacy, group chats, public message feeds, and more enhance the basic protocol for even more applications.\r\n\r\nThe **dm3** protocol is utilizing **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)** as a central (but decentralized) registry for communication information (like public keys for encryption and signature verification and information, how and where to deliver messages) and an open and scalable network of delivery service nodes for delivering messages or as gateways to other protocols or services.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the talk is to introduce the public good dm3 protocol, emphasize how interoperability is fundamental for web3 messaging applications and how interoperability is implemented with dm3, and show how secure and interoperable communication can be integrated into DApps.\r\n<tags>Ethereum</tags>",

    "Description": "Given an ethereum address, get all transactions involving it. Such a simple and fundamental thing to ask, though all EVM chains and other EVM inspired chains clients simply can't answer this easily.\r\n\r\nThe way the node client is built it's unable to provide this answer which has given raise to a host of problems as new protocols and indexing services arise to fill in the gap. As ethereum protocol development enters its 10th year the problem seems to be ignored and sweeped under the rug, such as with the removal of archive nodes.\r\n\r\nAll the above leads to a very unfortunate centralization of what was supposed to be a decentralized protocol. In the talk we will try to analyze the problem, some existing solutions and approaches and how we can do better so that ethereum can go into the next 100 years and have historical data available.\r\n<tags>Ethereum</tags>",

Then we got distracted by the scaling problem and started developing ZKRollups. We now even have ZKEVMs. All of these require massive proving servers, and that has been the focus of ZKP development.\r\n\r\nBut we still need privacy, and for that we need small fast provers that users can run themselves. And it needs to run in the wallets. i.e. in the browser and on their phones. This creates a set of challenges very different from the ones you find in ZKRollups. There are a number of developments, tricks, and research areas that can help devs bring privacy to the users and I will be talking about those.\r\n\r\n<tags>Ethereum</tags>",

    "Abstract": "Protocol researchers and developers from distant ecosystems gather to talk about their blockspace.",
    "Description": "We present a workshop centred around blockspace and its provision in four different ecosystems. Blockspace is the key resource supplied by blockchains, which allows users to transact. Considerable infrastructure has now seen the light of day towards refining blockspace and delivering more value across the stack, from users to the protocol. But blockspace is not an homogenous resource, being deeply tied with both the consensus protocols which supply it and the infrastructure which refines it. Comparing notes between ecosystems will allow us to uncover best practices and opportunities to learn from one another.\r\n\r\nOur workshop will feature researchers and developers from four different ecosystems, represented by:\r\n- [Robert Habermeier](https://twitter.com/rphmeier/status/1631467728555974658) (Polkadot)\r\n- [Sam Hart](https://twitter.com/SkipProtocol/status/1642895191857299458) (Skip Protocol)\r\n- [Jannik Luhn](https://twitter.com/project_shutter/status/1628430652990267393) (Shutter Network)\r\n- [Barnab\u00e9 Monnot](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot/status/1628836608270016517) (Robust Incentives Group @ Ethereum Foundation)\r\n\r\nEach speaker will present key facts about their blockspace, its design and its philosophy (4x 8mins each). After these opening remarks, we feature a panel moderated by [Christopher Goes](https://twitter.com/cwgoes) (Heliax) to dive into the deep questions (~40 mins). Expect resource pricing, MEV, base-layer encryption, composability and many other themes to be discussed!\r\n\r\n<tags>Cosmos, Ethereum, Polkadot, Gnosis</tags>",
    "Notes": "This is more to express interest, but should the workshop be accepted, we would discuss further with each other to come up with a final abstract, title and description. At the moment, all four of us have simply expressed interest, but we are also happy to include other ecosystems who will be represented at Protocol Berg, and to take cues from the organisers on how to run the session so that it fits well with other talks at Protocol Berg. We think it's a unique chance to all be in the same room :)",

As the lead developers of IPFS, we have therefore begun to explore more hybrid approaches.

These individuals are focused not only on maintaining Ethereum and the EVM as it exists today, but also on researching and implementing cutting-edge advancements which will help onboard the next wave of global users seeking the benefits of decentralized and censorship-resistant protocols. In short, the work done by this collective is of extreme importance to the long-term security of Ethereum.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, funding for core protocol work has historically come from a select number of entities, which only provides a fraction of the financial incentives compared to other available work (apps, L2s etc.), on a risk-adjusted basis. The Guild was created to serve as a counterbalance to this (and at worst, a funder of last resort), while providing core protocol contributors with a way to indirectly participate in the success of the broader ecosystem, and incentivize continued contributions over the long term.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I\u2019ll detail the different attributes and assurances that make Protocol Guild an ideal funding mechanism for Ethereum\u2019s core protocol development, something that can be used by Ethereum's ecosystem and community to fund core protocol development in a very unique way, that takes into consideration the past, present and future.\r\n<tags>Ethereum</tags>",

    "Abstract": "The \"Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer\" (or just Polkadot UC), represents the public service provided by the Polkadot Network: it is a trust-free, WebAssembly-based, multicore, internet-native omnipresent virtual machine which is highly resilient to interference and corruption. The present system of allocating resources of the Polkadot Ubiquitous Computer (parachain slot auctions) is based on a model of one-core-per-parachain: this is a legacy interpretation of the Polkadot platform and is not a reflection of its present capabilities. With Polkadot's capability to adapt to its users'need, a new paradign for allocating coretime is being implemented by ecosystem teams. Coretime on the Polkadot UC is envisioned to be sold by the Polkadot System in two separate formats: Bulk Coretime and Instantaneous Coretime. When a Polkadot Core is utilized, we say it is dedicated to a \"Task\" rather than a \"parachain\". The Task to which a Core is dedicated may change at every Relay-chain block and while one predominant type of Task is to secure a Cumulus-based blockchain (i.e. a parachain), other types of Tasks are envisioned. Bulk Coretime is sold periodically on a specialised system chain known as the \"Coretime-chain\" and allocated in advance of its usage, whereas Instantaneous Coretime is sold on the Relay-chain immediately prior to usage on a block-by-block basis.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to explain this paradigm change within the Polkadot community to adapt to end-user needs, provide more agility and reduce long-term design flows.",

Users can define custom instruction sets for a VM, specify how those compile to constraints, generate sub-machines and declare how to connect them. Moreover, the flexibility of powdr enables users to select from a variety of proving backends when generating the prover and verifier components.\r\n\r\nTo validate this concept, we have successfully developed a fully functional verifier that compiles (no-std) Rust code into eSTARK and Halo2 proofs via the RISC-V architecture. Additionally, we are currently working on adapting this verifier to wasm and Valida, VMs that take very different architectural approaches than RISC-V.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the success in various scenarios, blockchain systems, especially EVM-compatible ones that serially execute transactions, still face the significant challenge of limited throughput. Concurrent transaction execution is a promising technique to accelerate transaction processing and increase the overall throughput. Existing concurrency control algorithms, however, fail to obtain enough speedups in real-world blockchains due to the high-contention workloads.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will propose a novel operation-level concurrency control algorithm designed for blockchains.\r\nThe core idea behind our algorithm is that only operations depending on conflicts should be executed serially, while all other conflict-free operations can be executed concurrently. Therefore, in contrast to the traditional approaches, which block or abort the entire transaction when encountering conflicts, our algorithm introduces a redo phase to resolve conflicts at the operation level by re-executing conflicting operations only. We also develop a set of data dependency tracking mechanisms to achieve precise identification and speedy re-execution for conflicting operations. We implement a prototype named ParallelEVM based on Go Ethereum and evaluate ParallelEVM using real-world Ethereum blocks. The evaluation results show that ParallelEVM achieves an average speedup of 4.28\u00d7. If combined with state prefetching techniques, ParallelEVM can further accelerate the transaction execution by 7.11\u00d7.",

    "Abstract": "Blockchains, with their primary focus on decentralization, open participation, and resilience, inherently lack efficiency, scalability, and privacy. Similar to parallel computing algorithms, the scalability of a blockchain-based system depends on the extent to which computational tasks can be moved off-chain. Zero knowledge techniques, such as recursive SNARKs, offer an effective means of shifting computation off-chain, requiring only proof verification as part of the consensus process. Mina demonstrates the use of these techniques in its consensus algorithm Ouroboros Samasika and zkApps. Privacy poses a challenge in blockchain systems due to their open public ledgers. However, zero knowledge proofs enable reduced data exposure on the public ledger and allow fine-tuning of the level of disclosure. Etonec's payment system serves as an exemplary application showcasing enhanced privacy in blockchains.",

This workshop presents the cypherpunk principle for understanding the public and private, namely \u201ctransparency for the powerful, privacy for the rest of us\u201d - showing how to operationalise this in the context of decentralised infrastructures. The workshop presents the Nym mixnet as a privacy commons for libp2p, a core module for decentralised networking, used by Ethereum consensus clients and beyond. Recently, Chainsafe built a proof of concept integration of Nym for Lighthouse. This workshop will demo working code for running Libp2p traffic through the Nym mixnet, built with the Nym Rust SDK.\r\n\r\nDistributed infrastructures suffer from a common vulnerability: that traffic is exposed, can reveal IP addresses and be used to deanonymise operators. This puts both operator as well as nodes at risk of DDoS attacks as well as censorship. Mixnets function like a forest surrounding and sustaining the public goods of such core modules: they encrypt and mix network traffic across several layers of mix nodes, adding small time delays - a leafy canopy to obscure the patterns of communication that might otherwise reveal sensitive network information.\r\n<tags>Nym</tags>",

    "Abstract": "Immutable and verifiable content plays a key role in shaping the future of knowledge sharing for the good of all. At the same time, content represented in such a way amplifies the importance of routing; hashes are hard to remember, content keeps increasing, data moves and so do peers. This begs the question: how would we find \u201cstuff\u201d fast, efficiently and reliably without enabling centralised snooping? Find out what the InterPlanetary Network Indexer is addressing this issue for IPFS and FileCoin network.",
    "Description": "While the benefits of immutable content are undeniable, a key challenge lies in efficient and reliable routing. With content increasing exponentially and data constantly in motion, the need for fast and secure discovery becomes crucial. But how can we achieve this without compromising privacy and falling into centralized surveillance?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore IPNI (InterPlanetary Network Indexer) as a solution to address these challenges head-on. We will begin by understanding the role of immutability in shaping the future of the web and why it is crucial for the integrity of content. Recognizing the need to reduce barriers for adoption, we will delve into the strategies employed by IPNI to simplify the process without compromising privacy or enabling centralized snooping akin to analytics platforms of today.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss [cid.contact](http://cid.contact) as one of the largest IPNI instances to date, and discover how it serves as a robust and efficient content router, facilitating fast and reliable content discovery. We will also address the challenges associated with decentralization and consistency, privacy preservation, access control, \"just-in-time\" caching and replication.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the future, we will explore both the near-term goals and long-term horizon for IPNI and content routing. The near-term objectives will emphasize the acceleration of adoption, leveraging the groundwork already laid. Simultaneously, we will examine alternative solutions on the horizon that have the potential to complement or challenge the existing paradigm.\r\n\r\nJoin me on this journey as we unravel the complexities of content, routing, immutability, and adoption, and discover how IPNI is contributing to a better web for all.\r\n<tags>IPFS</tags>",

Attempts to solve these problems are very wide-ranging, drawing from notions of the state (DAO constitutionalism) to corporations (coin-voting shareholder governance). As a result, protocol work has become a byzantine maze of narratives and mismatched mental models which are often a poor fit for the technical affordances of blockchains.\r\n\r\nIn this keynote talk, we will share insights from 5 years of techno-cultural analysis in the crypto space. We'll then present several frameworks that reveal how accountability and legitimacy arise\u2014or don't\u2014in crypto protocols. Drawing from legal and political theory (featuring pirates), we'll share a political philosophy of crypto institutions that will help protocol stewards and core developers understand power, behavioral regulation, and even violence in the nature of the protocol.",

    "Abstract": "Metadata privacy is critical for personal and private data access. Today, mixnet-like systems are still the only privacy option for low latency data transfer that have been proven at scale. Other techniques are not far behind though, and can allow us to get similar or stronger privacy guarantees without sacrificing latency. I've advised a [funding program](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2022/announcing-rfp-014-the-one-with-private-retrieval/) over the last year aimed at supporting the transition to practice of private retrieval. This talk will survey currently available systems, and our current guesses for what methods can scale to widespread adoption.",
    "Description": "Last year, Protocol Labs launched a funding program for metadata-private data transfer. This program is rooted in the belief that a combination of cryptographic and systems techniques should be able to offer low latency private data transfer at scale. \r\n\r\nWe have worked with groups investigating paths by which PIR, Private set intersection, Multiparty Computation, trusted hardware, and homomorphic encryption can be applied to this problem. This talk will describe the state of the art, overhead costs, and promise of these various techniques.\r\n\r\nWe'll also look at ways in which the the problem can be relaxed. Traditionally, data transfer has focused on a web2 model of a single authoritative origin. Using content addressed data means both that integrity becomes much less of a problem, and allows data to be fetched from multiple remote locations. Incentivization is a useful primitive to unlink writers from readers by supporting a network intermediation layer. [Nym](https://nymtech.net/) has been a great example of the practicality of this mechanism, but it can be applied beyond mixnets as well.\r\n<tags>IPFS</tags>",

We'll then put this theory to practice by rolling our own toy implementation of the elliptic curve used in Ethereum and Bitcoin.",
